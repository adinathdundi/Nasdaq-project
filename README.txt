This mini-project was done mainly to understand the cogwheels of the stock market. There were various terminologies involved which I had zero knowledge about. This project aided me(to a certain extent) in understanding the market.

If just starting out and a newbie, I suggest:
- Get a mentor
- Find out what you hope to gain from this analysis
- Stick to it

I mainly wanted to see for myself which industry sector faired well in the past 10 years and the reason behind it.

The analysis is fairly simple and uses graphs for visual aid. I completed the EDA in 6 days devoting 3 hours per day.

The data was downloaded from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/kalilurrahman/nasdaq100-stock-price-data)
